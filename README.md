# ReVerb

## Introduction
ReVerb is a music training app and toolkit, created by musicians, and designed for musician’s by providing industry standard tools at convenience, as well as providing motivation for both returning musicians and curious souls eager to start their musical journey. ReVerb achieves this through gamification and ease of accessibility to reduce that initial hesitancy to practise, with the ultimate goal of inspiring healthy habits that eventually allows one to accomplish their musical goals: be it from playing their favourite songs to destress, to performing in front of dozens. 

ReVerb was developed under the [Orbital Programme](https://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg) organised by the [National University of Singapore's School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg), and was awarded with the [Apollo 11](https://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/levels-of-achievement) Level of Achievement.
